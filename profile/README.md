## Background
Learning how to play musical instruments is an excellent way to enhance cognitive skills and motoric abilities. Among musical instruments, the piano stands out as an ideal choice due to its versatility and relatively simple learning curve.

However, many beginner pianists often struggle to identify and correct mistakes, leading to slower progress and ingrained bad habits.

While professional lessons can address these challenges, they come with their own set of limitations. Yet, for many, professional piano lessons are impractical due to high costs and rigid schedules. Many learners struggle to find lessons that align with their schedule or budget.
